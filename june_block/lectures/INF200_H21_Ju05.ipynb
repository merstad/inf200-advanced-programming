    "# Plotting in Python scripts and the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel programs\n",
    "    - A program may run internally on multiple *threads*\n",
    "    - *Threads* are essentially multiple \"workers\" inside a single program working in parallel\n",
    "    - Problem: Two workers may change the same data at the same time: Chaos!\n",
    "    - Solution in CPython: The GIL\n",
    "- GIL: Global Interpreter Lock\n",
    "    - Present in CPython and several other Python implementations\n",
    "    - In each Python program, there is *exactly one* GIL (think of it as a baton,  \"stafettpinne\")\n",
    "    - Only the thread holding the GIL can work, all others are paused\n",
    "- Plotting and the GIL\n",
    "    - Usually, a figure window is managed by its own thread\n",
    "    - The thread can only draw to the screen while it has the GIL\n",
    "    - In a loop like (`plt` is `matplotlib.pyplot`)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        for alpha in range(100):\n",
    "            plt.plot(x, sin(alpha*x))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "      the graphics thread may never get access to the GIL\n",
    "    - We must *pause* the main thread to ensure figure updating\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        for alpha in range(100):\n",
    "            plt.plot(x, sin(alpha*x))\n",
    "            plt.pause(1e-6)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Pause duration is in seconds and can be very short\n",
    "- Other (more or less) relevant plot commands\n",
    "    - `plt.show()` hands over the GIL to the figure thread, the main thread is frozen until the figure window is closed; usually to be used as the last line in a script, so the user can look at the figure(s) generated\n",
    "    - `plt.ion()` (\"interactive on\") ensures that figures are updated automatically after each `plt` command (e.g. change in axis limits); meaningful when working interactively in an IPython shell or updating in a loop while displaying \"live\",\n",
    "    - `plt.ioff()` turns interactive mode off again,\n",
    "    - `plt.draw()` updates figure; when not in interactive mode, the effect of many `plt` commands will become visible only upon `plt.draw()`\n",
    "    - `FigureCanvasBase.flush_events()` is called on a figure canvas and ensures all pending \"events\", e.g., changes to the drawing, are executed and the figure is updated\n",

    "# Updating data in plots\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example program: `plotting/plot_update.py`\n",
    "    - Creates list of random numbers, updates plot every time a new number is added\n",
    "    - Note the slow-down when running function `replot(1000)`\n",
    "    - Then run just function `update(1000)`: no slow-down\n",
    "- Plotting using `Figure` and `Axes` objects\n",
    "    - Plotting using `plt....()` functions is easy, but limits our possibilities\n",
    "    - By using the equivalent methods on `Figure`, `Axes`, `Line`, etc objects, we get much more control\n",
    "- Reason:\n",
    "    - `plt.plot()` adds new coordinate system (`Artist`) to figure each time it is called\n",
    "    - Matplotlib must render all `Artist`s each time the plot is updated\n",
    "- Solution:\n",
    "    - Call `plt.plot()` once, afterwards just update the values\n",

    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Notes:\n",
    "        - We start with a line having as many data points as we want to have in the end\n",
    "        - We set all y-values to `np.nan` (not-a-number), a special value that is *not plotted*\n",
    "        - We must set x and y axis limits before we plot\n",
    "        - `line.set_ydata(ydata)` updates the data in the figure\n",
    "        - The `fig.canvas.flush_events()` call ensures that everything is plotted in the figure. This can slow down the code. Without it, though, there is a risk that not everything is shown on the screen. Another approach is to make the `pause()` longer."

    "- Do you have unit tests for all methodes in classes for animals and landscape types?\n",
    "- Do you have tests for the island and simulation classes?\n",
    "- You do **not** need to write tests for visualisation.\n",
    "- Are your tests meaningful and sufficiently comprehensive?\n",
    "- Are the tests well written?\n",
    "- Do you use some advanced techniques, such as parameterization, fixtures and statistical tests?\n",
    "- Full score requires comprehensive tests including good use of parameterization, fixtures and statistical tests.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Do you have meaningfull docstrings for all classes and methods?\n",
    "- Are docstrings reasonably formatted?\n",
    "- Do you have documentation text describing the parts of BioSim and how to use them?\n",
