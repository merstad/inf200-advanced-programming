   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RandVis' documentation!
==================================

RandomVisualization is a small Python package developed solely for pedagogical purposes.
The key points illustrated are how to

* visualize matrices using :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`
* create a video from saved graphics files using `FFmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org>`_
* provide a :class:`simulation` that provides a user interface to the simulated system
* document code with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_
* create a distributable package using Python :mod:`distutils`

The package does nothing meaningful, it just generates a random matrix, modifies that
matrix for each simulation step and displays the resulting matrix and mean element 
value at given intervals.
