    Fixture setting class parameters on Bacteria.

    The fixture sets Bacteria parameters when called for setup,

    parameters are always reset before leaving a test.

    This fixture should be called via parametrize with indirect=True.

    the set_params fixture defined above, passing the dictionary

    This test is a probabilistic test: It executes dies() N times.
    The number n of "successes" (dies() returns True) should be
    distributed according to the binomial distribution B(N, p),
    where p is short for p_death. For large N, the distribution
    is approximately normal (law of large numbers) with mean
    Np and variance Np(1-p).

    Then, Z = ( n - Np ) / sqrt( N p (1-p) ) is distributed according
    to the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Thus,
    if dies() works correctly, we will observe Z < -Z* or Z > Z* only
    with probability Phi(-Z*) + ( 1-Phi(Z*) ) = 2 * Phi(-Z*), where
    equality follows from the symmetry of the normal distribution.
    This is the probability mass in the tails of the distribution.

    We can choose a signficance level alpha, e.g. 0.01, and
    pass the test if 2*Phi(-|Z|) > alpha: The test passes if the
    probability mass outside (-|Z], |Z]) is at least alpha (the
    observed value of Z is not in the alpha-tail of the distribution).
