    "The process is similar to creating share repositories in the fall term. A template is available in the `inf200-course-materials` repository. Proceed as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the shared repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On your computer, pull all updates from the inf200-course-materials repository.\n",
    "    - Under `june_block/biosim_template` you will now find several directories (`biosim`, `examples`, `tests` and a `sample.gitignore` file). \n",

    "    1. In your `Uxx_FirstName1_FirstName2` group on GitLab, create a new project.\n",
    "    1. Select \"Create blank project\".\n",
    "\t1. Choose project name `BioSim Uxx FirstName1 FirstName2`. The corresponding \"Project slug\" will then be `biosim-uxx-firstname1-firstname2`.  Here, `xx` is your group number (with leading zero!) and `FirstName1` and `FirstName2` your first names as in the group name.\n",
    "    1. Check off for \"Intialize repository with a README\".\n",
    "1. One of you then does the following on your computer:\n",
    "    1. Start PyCharm and select `Get from VCS`\n",
    "\t1. Paste the URL from the GitLab clone button and choose a sensible location on your computer.\n",
    "\t1. Once PyCharm has cloned and opened the project, ensure that the correct Python interpreter is chosen (the `inf200` conda environment).\n",
    "\t1. You should now have the project in folder `biosim-uxx-firstname1-firstname2` in your repo.\n",
    "\t1. Now copy all directories and the `sample.gitignore` file from the `biosim_template` folder into the project folder. They should show up in PyCharm after a little moment.\n",
    "\t1. Rename `sample.gitignore` to `.gitignore` by right-clicking the file name in PyCharm and chosing Refactor > Rename.\n",
    "\t1. Commit all new files to Git (either in PyCharm, GitAhead or your preferred git program) and push to GitLab.\n",
    "1. Now the other partner can clone the project in PyCharm as described above and you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work planning on GitLab\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use some of GitLab's project management features: *Issues*, *Milestones*, *Labels*, and *Merge Requests*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For each of the milestones related to code developement that is given above and in Table 1 of the project description, create a milestone in GitLab (with due date). You can add more milestones.\n",
    "- Create labels to mark work related to different aspects of you work, e.g., code, documentation, tests and deployment.\n",
    "- Create an issue for each thing you need to do and assign it to your project and a milestone and label it.\n",
    "- Do development work in branches and create merge requests to integrate it into your master branch. Review your requests together with your partner.\n",
    "- Use the issue board (Kanban board) to manage and track the progress of your work.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Important notes:\n",
    "\n",

    "    - The \"Labels\" menu item is now under \"Subgroup information\" or \"Project information\", not  under \"Issues\" as in the video.\n",
