    "\n",
    "The following are key principles of semantic versioning from semver.org. See that page for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API ... it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive.\n",
    "1. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where ... X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically.\n",
    "1. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.\n",
    "1. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.\n",
    "1. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.\n",
    "1. **Patch version Z** (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.\n",
    "1. **Minor version Y** (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.\n",
    "1. **Major version X** (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards *incompatible* changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented."
