    "    - check that requirements are fulfilled\n",
    "    - stop execution if requirement not fulfilled\n",
    "    - key use cases\n",
    "        - very simple \"emergency stops\" if we don't want to spend time on proper error handling\n",
    "        - catching things that \"cannot happen\", but where we want to be on the safe side (in large projects, you never know ...)\n",
    "- **Exceptions**\n",
    "    - mechanism for signaling that something unexpected happended\n",
    "    - available in most modern programming languages\n",
    "    - exceptions are *raised* or *thrown* when a problem is detected\n",
    "    - exceptions can be *caught* and *handled*, e.g., by issuing a useful error message\n",
    "    - in some languages, e.g., Python, exceptions are also used as part of normal programming\n",
    "- **Testing**\n",
    "    - systematic testing of code can help us to find errors\n",
    "    - a proper set of tests also helps us to avoid introducing new errors as software evolves\n",
    "    - *unit tests* are tests of small parts of code, typically functions\n",
    "    - *integration tests* test that the parts of a larger project work together\n",
    "    - *regression tests* are added when a bug is discovered\n",
    "        - the test reproduces the bug\n",
    "        - when the bug is fixed, the test passes\n",
    "        - we keep the test, in case we should re-introduce the bug by a later change (regress)"
