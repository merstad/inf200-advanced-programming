"""
Compute number of mandates for each party based on the modified Sainte-Laguë rule.

The rule works as follows:
1. Each party receives a score equal to the number of votes received divided by 1.4.
2. All parties are sorted in descending order of scores.
3. The party with the largest score is then
   a. assigned a seat
   b. receives a new score, which is its number of votes divided by 3.
4. The process continues with point 2, successively using divisors 3, 5, 7, ..., until
   all seats have been assigned.

Note that divisors are increased independently for each party.

Expected results from this code are:

    A, H: 5 mandates each
    FRP, SP: 2 mandates each
    MDG, RØDT, SV, V: 1 mandate each

Høyre has six mandates from Akershus in total in the current Storting because they were allocated
the utjevningsmandat for Akershus.
