    "\n",
    "#### Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code (70%)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delivery 20%\n",
    "- Quality 20%\n",
    "- Tests 15%\n",
    "- Documentation 10%\n",
    "- Bonus 5%\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exam (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presentation 10%\n",
    "- Discussion 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally, joint evaluation for code, individual evaluation for exam\n",
    "- Deviation possible if there is clear indication that partners differ very strongly in contributions and competence\n",
    "- In each category, A-F logic is applied:\n",
    "    - On a 0-100 point scale, \"just passing\" is usually at 40% (lower end of E)\n",
    "    - Thus, e.g., for *Delivery*, a \"just passing\" code will give 40% of 20%, i.e., 8% to the total, while a perfect delivery would give 20% to the total.\n",
    "- General definition of grades (https://www.uhr.no/_f/p1/i4bfb251a-5e7c-4e34-916b-85478c61a800/karaktersystemet_generelle_kvalitative_beskrivelser.pdf):\n",
    "    - A: An excellent performance, clearly outstanding. The candidate demonstrates excellent judgement and a very high degree of independent thinking.\n",
    "    - B: A very good performance. The candidate demonstrates sound judgement and a high degree of independent thinking.\n",
    "    - C: A good performance in most areas. The candidate demonstrates a reasonable degree of judgement and independent thinking in the most important areas.\n",
    "    - D: A satisfactory performance, but with significant shortcomings. The candidate demonstrates a limited degree of judgement and independent thinking.\n",
    "    - E: A performance that meets the minimum criteria, but no more. The candidate demonstrates a very limited degree of judgement and independent thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements in different categories\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does your code deliver on all requirements described in Sec. 1–3 of the task description?\n",
    "- Full score (20%) requires that all is in place and works.\n",
    "- Minimum requirement to pass is herbivores, carnivores, migration on an island with one landscape type, plotting of total number of animals of each species, and ability to run via the BioSim class (eg `check_sim`, `test_biosim_interface`)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is your code well written?\n",
    "    - Sensible organisation of code into classes?\n",
    "    - Well-chosen class and variable names?\n",
    "    - Is the encapsulation principle in object-oriented programming observed?\n",
    "    - Do you follow PEP8 rules (but with lines up to 100 characters allowed)?\n",
    "- Are there any bugs?\n",
    "- Is your code well readable?\n",
    "- Is your code reasonably efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you have unit tests for all methodes in classes for animals and landscape types?\n",
    "- Do you have tests for the island and simulation classes?\n",
    "- You do **not** need to write tests for visualisation.\n",
    "- Are your tests meaningful and sufficiently comprehensive?\n",
    "- Are the tests well written?\n",
    "- Do you use some advanced techniques, such as parameterization, fixtures and statistical tests?\n",
    "- Full score requires comprehensive tests including good use of parameterization, fixtures and statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you have meaningfull docstrings for all classes and methods?\n",
    "- Are docstrings reasonably formatted?\n",
    "- Do you have documentation text describing the parts of BioSim and how to use them?\n",
    "- For a \"B\"-level score, you must also use at least one advanced Sphinx features, e.g., example code, note boxes, mathematics, or figures\n",
    "- For an \"A\"-level score, you must use several advanced Sphinx features including math and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this category, you can earn up to 5% extra for features beyond the requirements of Sec 1–3 or extraordinarily well-written code."
